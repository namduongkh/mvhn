        It’s been designed to run your education business. It’s built for compliance, for enrolment management, for scheduling, and for reporting.

        But it’s more than that. It’s MORE than your average student management system. WE THINK DIFFERENTLY. Our aim is to help you BE BETTER.
        <br/>
        Just as all students are different, so too are the providers who educate them. We want JobReady Plus to be not just easier to use, but more enjoyable. You should love the system you choose. You should have the confidence to deliver the best outcomes for students, even as the student lifecycle becomes ever more complex. You have a responsibility to help your students navigate the complexity of their journey and offer them the best chance to succeed.
        <br/>
        JobReady Plus will give you all the information you need. In the way you want it. You will have the full picture of every individual student’s journey, so you can build your own modern experience, relevant for your students of today. But, choosing to partner with JobReady, means you will be in a position to deliver the student experience of tomorrow.
